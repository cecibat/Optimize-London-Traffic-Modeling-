# Optimize-London-Traffic-Modeling-
This project aims to describe, model and optimize London traffic. It is approached as a network traffic model problem, where the network is described by a graph. Each node represents a relevant suburb of London - relevant w.r.t given assumptions. There is a main node which is London itself.

There are roads between certain suburbs, hence represented by arcs. A road between nodes i and j is given by an arc (i; j). The network structure described is strictly dependent on the topology of the London area.
It is assumed that a signicant portion of commuters want to travel by car from suburb to downtown, but also that there are commuters who travel from one suburb to another one.

Demand between areas, areas' choice, network topology derived from a detailed online research as better explained in the report.

This project is performed in GAMS.
